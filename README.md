🔐 Explored password security using John the Ripper on Kali Linux. Tested MD5, SHA-1, and bcrypt to see how hashing and salting affect protection. Inspired by a blockchain penetration testing research paper, we simplified its concepts into practice. Key insight: weak passwords remain easy to crack even with salting.
